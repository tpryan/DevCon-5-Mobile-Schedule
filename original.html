			While HTML5 is mostly about evolution, some of the features in the Connectivity and RealTime area are, in fact, pretty revolutionary. Combining the power of socket connections for protocol communication, rich graphics, and offline capabilities makes it possible for web apps to be on par, or even better than, desktop applications.
			</p>
			<p>
			This is precisely what makes HTML5 so compelling. HTML5 is making the web more interactive and in the quicker. It also reduces the need for middleware with HTML5. Peter will explore what some of the major new feature areas are when it comes to HTML5 connectivity and real time and how those are changing how you will build modern web apps.

			Most mobile Web developers come from a traditional desktop development background. As such, many are not aware of key differences between desktop browsers and mobile browsers once they are trying to build an app vs a traditional web site, even if adapted for mobile. In this introductory session aimed at desktop developers interested in making the jump to mobile, we will present the technical tricks that are needed to circumvent a mobile browsers own interface touch and gesture management, viewport and other aspects to deliver a web app that looks and feels like a native app. We will discuss among other things how to virtualize the browsers own event loop, block swipe and pinch/zoom gestures, pin down the viewport, and a simple trick to build a mobile touchbased app that also works on a desktop browser with mouse events.

			HTML5 WebSocket is a new standardized API and protocol for continuous, bidirectional, lowoverhead communications between browsers and remote hosts. It enables the development of a new generation of dynamic, browserbased web applications.
			</p>
			<p>
			Although the basic concept of a WebSocketenabled application is relatively simple, the actual implementation of this technology involves a number of steps which require careful attention to detail. In this session you will come up to speed quickly on the basics of WebSocket and you will learn what is involved in building realtime WebSocketbased applications.

			AliceJS is an open source micro javascript library http://blackberry.github.com/Alice that simplifies doing advanced animations with CSS. Itâ€™s self contained and works directly against the DOM to support a variety of use cases for web applications. With one line of JavaScript code, you can make almost any DOM elements swerve around the page while retaining a great amount of control with respect to animation parameters. Additionally, the framework introduced the concept of Organics, adding randomization characteristics to create visual effects that are subtly different each time they play out. Used for games as well as regular business apps, AliceJS can help bring freshness and polish to your work in a very simple and straightforward manner.

			The element represents the hottest new feature in HTML5 development, something all the major browsers are working on. While browsers currently donâ€™t expose much about video, will allow users to share all sorts of textual data about the video. Content owners will be able to increase accessibility for the content, utilizing captions and descriptions for users who canâ€™t hear or see the video. Searchability will play a major role as well, as will give search engines even more data, improving accuracy, translations, and location. This presentation will give an overview of capabilities and look at how it will impact the future ofHTML5 programming. This session will also inform developers of how they can make better use of their video data by working with the element.

			The religious debate between native and html5 as the best approach for mobile application continues to rage.  Yet most enterprises are making this decision without understanding the broader implications such as user experience, security, app certification, revenue share, extensibility, and the evolving ecosystem around both solutions.  Apple, Google, and even Microsoft continue to drive more innovation into the device such as sensors, voice agents, gestures while large players like Facebook and Amazon are lining up with force behind html5 as a way around the stronghold of device makers.  Dramatic advances in the cloud further stoke the debate as cloud players are incentivized to put more capabilities into the browser.  This session will address how enterprises can achieve the right balance between html5 and native development to meet the needs of their mobile users.
